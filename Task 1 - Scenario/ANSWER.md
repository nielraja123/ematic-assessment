# Button Not Working - Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview

A client reaches out to you to seek assistance on an issue they're currently experiencing on their website. The only information provided to you by the client is that "a button is not working". Please provide a step-by-step approach that you would take in an attempt to solve the client's issue.

## Steps Taken

1. **Ask for Further Explanation**: First, I would ask the client to provide more information about the issue. I will ask about the type of button that is not working, which page the button is located on, and what happens when the button is clicked.

2. **Ask the Client to Demonstrate**: Directly witnessing the client's state when pressing the button, because there may be things that the client is not aware of, so the information received by me is incomplete.

3. **Inspect Website/Code**: I will request access to the source code of the web page, if possible. With this access, I will inspect the code associated with the button that is not working. I'll find out if there are any syntax errors, connection errors, or other issues that might be causing the button not to work.

4. **Test on Various Browsers**: I will try accessing the website with different browsers, OS, and devices to ensure that the issue is not related to a specific browser or device.

5. **Test on Various Screen Resolutions**: Access the website using different screen resolutions to ensure that the issue is not resolution-specific.

6. **Test on Various Internet Connections**: Access the website using different internet connections (Wi-Fi, cellular, cable) to ensure that the issue is not connection-specific.

7. **Test on Various Security Settings**: Check the client's browser and device security settings to ensure that the issue is not related to specific security settings that may prevent the button from functioning.

8. **Check for Ad Blockers**: Check if there are any ad blockers installed on the client's browser that may be preventing the button from functioning.

9. **Contact Developer**: If a solution cannot be found, contact the website's developer for further assistance.

10. **Capture Screenshots or Videos**: If the issue persists, request the client to capture screenshots or videos of the issue so that further troubleshooting can be done.

11. **Create a Report**: Once a solution is found, create a report detailing the steps taken to resolve the issue and the solution that was found.

12. **Request Testing**: If necessary, request the client to test the solution to ensure that the issue is resolved.

13. **Provide Recommendations**: Provide the client with recommendations on steps they can take to prevent the issue from occurring in the future.

14. **Follow-Up**: Follow up with the client after the solution has been implemented to ensure that the issue does not occur again.
